In the model of continuous spatially-dependent effective mass and rectangular potential of electron in plane single-well nanostructure the solutions of stationary Schrodinger equation are obtained and the influence of the width of the pre-surface between the nanostructure well and the barriers on the electron energy spectrum is analyzed. It is established that the widening of the pre-surface region brings to the monotonous low-energy shift of the electron states energies. The magnitudes of the shifts increase when the number of the energy level becomes bigger in the groups of odd and even states.
Keywords: nanosystem, effective mass, energy spectrum.
